MTLD, vocd-D, and HD-D: A validation study of sophisticated approaches to lexical diversity assessment 

**Abstract**

-The main purpose of this study: to examine the validity of the approach to lexical diversity assessment known as the measure of textual lexical diversity (MTLD). 
-vocd-D, TTR, Maas, Yule’s K, and an HD-D index derived directly from the hypergeometric distribution function. 
-The comparisons involved assessments of convergent validity, divergent validity, internal validity, and incremental validity. 
- The results of our assessments of these indices across two separate corpora suggest three major find ings. 
First, MTLD performs well with respect to all four types of validity and is, in fact, the only index not found to vary as a function of text length. 
-Second, HD-D is a viable alternative to the vocd-D standard.
- And third, three of the indices—MTLD, vocd-D (or HD-D), and Maas—appear to capture unique lexical information.
- to consider using MTLD, vocd-D (or HD-D), and Maas in their studies, rather than any single index, noting that lexical diversity can be assessed in many ways and each approach may be informative as to the construct under investigation.

*Introduction*

- Lexical diversity (LD): the range of different words used in a text, with a greater range indicating a higher diversity
- Traditional LD indices, like type-token ratio (TTR), are problematic due to their sensitivity to text length, leading to potentially misleading findings. 
- Recent methods like vocd-D and the measure of textual lexical diversity (MTLD) claim to assess LD without being affected by text length. 
- While vocd-D has been extensively documented and used, MTLD lacks detailed description, validation, and systematic comparison with other indices. 
- This study aims to address these gaps by evaluating the validity of MTLD in LD assessment.

1.	CONSIDERATIONS IN THE ASSESSMENT OF LEXICAL DIVERSITY
-	Text Length
-	Textual Homogeneity
-	Sequential and Nonsequential Analysis Processing

2.	INDICES OF LEXICAL DIVERSITY
-	vocd-D
The calculation of vocd-D is the result of a series of random text samplings. 
The approach begins its calculation by taking from the text 100 random samples of 35 tokens. 
The TTR for each of these samples is calculated, and the mean TTR is stored. 
The same procedure is then repeated for samples from 36 to 50 tokens. 
An empirical TTR curve is then created from the means of each of these samples. 
The D coefficient (see Malvern et al., 2004, p. 51) is then used as part of a formula to produce a theoretical curve that most closely fits the empirical TTR curve formed from the random samples.
 The value of the best-fitting D is referred to as D. Because D is arrived at by random sampling, the value varies each time the assessment is run. Thus, to create a higher level of consistency, the procedure above is run three times, and an average D is the final out put.
 Final values tend to range from 10 to 100, with higher values indicating greater diversity.

-	HD-D 
The hypergeometric distribution represents the probability of drawing (without replacement) a certain number of tokens of a particular type from a sample of a particu lar size.
 The way we have used this distribution for our own HD-D index is to calculate, for each lexical type in a text, the probability of encountering any of its tokens in a random sample of 42 words drawn from the text.
 The probabilities for all lexical types in the text are then added together, and the sum is used as an index of the text’s LD. As was previously mentioned, HD-D is what vocd-D approximates. 
This calculation is conducted by taking into consideration the mean contribution that each type makes to the TTR of all possible combinations of a sample of a certain size. If the sample size is 42, the mean contribution of any given type is 1/42 multiplied by the percentage of combinations in which the type would be found. 
This percentage is exactly the same as the probability of encountering the type in a sample of 42 words drawn from the text, and this can be determined directly from the hypergeometric distribution
The HD-D output is literally sums of probabilities, whereas vocd-D output is essen tially sums of probabilities converted to type–token ratios and, then again, from type–token ratios to a D value.
-	Other LD Indices Used in This Study
Log correction
we include Maas in the present analysis as the most representative LD index from the log correction approach. Frequency correction. 
the frequency distribution of types
Text A and Text B may contain exactly the same overall number of types and tokens; however, the number of tokens for each type may differ. 
as with the Maas index, McCarthy and Jarvis (2007) showed that one frequency index, K, was reasonably effective. Indeed, K showed no effect of text length if analyses were limited to the following ranges: 100–500, 154–666, 250–1,000, and 400–2,000. 
Given these results, our study includes K as the best representative LD index of the frequency correction type. Regarding K, one further point of interest is highly relevant to the vocd-D calculation. 
Whereas vocd-D is determined by the sums of probabilities of encountering each type in the text in sample sizes from 35 to 50 tokens, K is determined by the sums of probabilities of encountering each type in the text when the sample size is set to just 2 words. Both indices also involve a scale conversion, but the important point is that they form a continuum, both relying on the hypergeometric distribution, where K’s sample size is set to 2 words and vocd-D’s sample size is set to 35–50 words.

3.	MTLD 
-Processing MTLD
-Partial Factors
-Forward and Reverse Processing

-Calculation of MTLD Value
 The total number of words in the text is divided by the total factor count. For example, if the text 340 words and the factor count 4.404, then the MTLD value is 77.203. Two such MTLD values are calculated, one for forward processing and one for reverse processing. The mean of the two values is the final MTLD value. 
Factor Size
 MTLD uses a default factor size of .720. This default factor size is used in the MTLD prototype that features in the Coh-Metrix suite of textual analysis indices and is the factor size used in the engineering studies that have in corporated MTLD 
The Rationale for MTLD 
LD index known as mean segmental TTR (MSTTR; John son, 1944).
The MSTTR approach divides a text into se ments of a set length (typically, 100 words). The remaining words are discarded. The TTR for each full segment is calculated, and the final TTR value is the mean of all full segments. 
MSTTR has several problems for shorter texts. 
First, discarding any amount of text reduces the text’s integrity and, therefore, reduces the validity of the evaluation. 
Second, the choice of segment size is problematic: Using smaller segments (e.g., 10 words) results in a smaller size of discarded text. However, the smaller the segment, the lower the sensitivity of the index. 
The MTLD approach replaces word segments with TTR factors results in conjunction with the present validation study do offer confidence that MTLD is a valuable resource for researchers using LD.

CONSTRUCT VALIDITY
the Measure of Textual Lexical Diversity (MTLD) showed no correlation with text length, suggesting high internal validity, while other indices like TTR, HD-D, vocd-D, Maas, and K did show correlations. 
MTLD, vocd-D, and Maas were identified as containing unique information, with MTLD and Maas showing incremental validity by distinguishing different text registers in the MJ corpus. 
MTLD demonstrated divergent validity by correlating negatively with cohesion measures. The findings suggest that MTLD is a robust LD index, though further research is needed to explore its variations and applications across different genres and settings.

Validation Results

General discussion 
MTLD, vocd-D (or HD-D), and Maas capture unique LD information, suggesting that a combination of these indices provides a comprehensive assessment of LD across different text registers.
